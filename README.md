# Sam Houston

I am a very passionate and motivated developer. I love problem solving and taking on new challenges.

Since finishing my formal education, I have immersed myself in programming and have worked really hard in my exiciting new world of web/mobile development.

I have been working as a full-stack developer for a number of companies and have specialised in using React + Redux in the front end and Node js in the backend.
